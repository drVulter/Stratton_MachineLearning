# Machine Learning Clustering Project
### Quinn Stratton

For this project, I added functionality for the k-medians and k-mediods algorithms to the existing clustering algorithm that we worked on as a class. To choose the used algorithm, change the /clusterType/ global variable in the main class. 0: k-means, 1:k-medians, 2 or more: k-medoids. I'm afraid that the k-medoids is not working properly, but I believe that the k-medians is working well.
