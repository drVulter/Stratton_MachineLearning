# Machine Learning Project Two 
#### Quinn Stratton

This program is an extension of the one written for project1. In addition to
performing the k-NN algorithm on the fruit dataset, the program now calculates
and displays the macro and micro average for our classification. In this case,
the macro average was larger than the micro average, which indicates a 
potential problem with the evaluation of the larger class. The difference 
between the two is not staggering, but I would be curious to see if this would
be exacerbated if this same algorithm were applied to a similar but larger 
dataset.
